# Add Chord Express
## Userscript for Twiddler Tuner

This Userscript optimizes the activity of adding chord-mappings for users of the Twiddler Tuner. It reduces the number of user-interactions to add a single binding from 6 steps to 3, only one of which (selecting chords) is clicking.

The normal process for adding key mappings in the Twiddler Tuner is click-intensive.

1. Click 'add new chord' button
2. Click 'editt' for the new chord
3. Click the key mapping text area to focus on it
4. Type your desired output
5. Click the chord you want to map from
6. Click 'apply' to set
0. Wait for page to reload then start again.

ACE automatically does the first three steps- adding a binding, editing it, and focusing on the keymapping. Enter your output, make your chord selection, then use thte new control-space hottkey to apply the chordmapping.
